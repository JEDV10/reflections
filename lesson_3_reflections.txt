When would you wnat to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?
 
	Mainly when you want to work collaboratively with other teams. It is also useful 
when you want to maintain a copy of your work and work from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because there can be another person who is working simultaneously on the same 
project so you son't wnat anybody modifying your code while you have not finish your
part.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?

	Branches are different explotarion paths on your project allowing you to make 
changes and test their results without losing the main code. Clones are copies of
your entire repository. They can be local (another folder) or remote (in GitHub). 
Forks are your own vertions of other's repositories and act like new repositories so
you can clone them locally or make new branches.
