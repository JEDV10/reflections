When would you wnat to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
local?
 
	Mainly when you want to work collaboratively with other teams. It is also useful 
when you want to maintain a copy of your work and work from different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because there can be another person who is working simultaneously on the same 
project so you son't wnat anybody modifying your code while you have not finish your
part.
